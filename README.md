# Line Follower Robot Webpage

A webpage with Arduino code and a step-by-step guide to build a line-following robot using IR sensors and DC motors. Includes copyable code, wiring instructions, and resources for beginners.

## Live Demo
Visit the guide at - (https://shivam2332.github.io/line-follower-robot-webpage/)
## Features
- **IR Sensors**: Detect a black line (pins 11, 12).
- **DC Motors**: Controlled via PWM (pins 5-10) for smooth movement.
- **Webpage**: Interactive guide with copyable Arduino code, troubleshooting tips, and learning resources.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear instructions for Arduino and robotics newbies.

## How to Use
1. **View the Webpage**: Open the live demo link above to read the guide and copy the Arduino code.
2. **Build the Robot**: Follow the webpage’s wiring and setup instructions (needs Arduino, 2 IR sensors, 2 DC motors, motor driver).
3. **Download Code**: Get `LineFollowerRobot.ino` from this repo or copy from the webpage.
4. **Test**: Place the robot on a black line (white background) and tweak settings if needed.
